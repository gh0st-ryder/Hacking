//  Warning: This solution is way too cumbursome and ugly.

//  My other solution is way more elegant, and just as efficient!

//Amortized data structure for O(1) average time, and O(h) memory
//
//The iterator maintains an inner vector of ptrs, of O(h) size for the next O(h) minimums
//Every hasNext() is O(1)
//First h next() are O(1) time, because they are read directly from vector
//The next h-th next() call causes re-population, so it is O(h) time
//however, amortized over (h+1) next() calls, every next() call is AVERAGE O(1) time!
